\hfill \textit{LHCb Collaboration}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep -3pt {}
\item Study of $CP$ asymmetries in charm decays at the \href{https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/}{LHCb Collaboration}.

\textbf{Continuum limit of the low-lying baryon spectrum} \hfill Sept 2022 - May 2023\\
BSc Thesis, Project Supervisor:  \href{https://www.cyi.ac.cy/index.php/castorc/about-the-center/castorc-our-people/itemlist/user/99-constantia-alexandrou.html}{Prof. Constantia Alexandrou}\hfill \textit{University of Cyprus}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep -3pt {} 
\item The thesis was a continuation of the previous project and the purpose was to complete the calculations for the baryon mass spectrum.
\item Became familiar with the environment of exascale computers.
\item Implementation of model averaging for bias elimination.
\item Using three different ensembles with different lattice spacings and various computational techniques it was possible to calculate the baryon mass spectrum at the continuum limit and compare the results to the experimental values.
\item Prediction of previously unmeasured masses of doubly- and triply-charmed baryons.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Low-lying baryon spectrum using lattice QCD simulations} \hfill May 2022 - Jun 2022\\
Undergdraduate Internship, Project Supervisor:  \href{https://www.cyi.ac.cy/index.php/castorc/about-the-center/castorc-our-people/itemlist/user/99-constantia-alexandrou.html}{Prof. Constantia Alexandrou}\hfill \textit{University of Cyprus}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep -3pt {} 
\item Calculation of various baryon masses using correlator data generated from lattice QCD simulations.
\item Implementation of methods for evaluating the low-lying baryon spectrum at finite lattice spacing.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Wave function of the universe for the Starobinsky inflationary model} \hfill Jun 2021 - Aug 2021\\
Undergdraduate Internship, Project Supervisor:  \href{https://www.ucy.ac.cy/directory/en/profile/nick}{Prof. Nicolaos Toumbas}\hfill \textit{University of Cyprus}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep -3pt {} 
\item The main purpose of this project was to see whether initial conditions favouring inflation are probable.
\item We approximated the Starobinsky potential as a step function and we used the WKB approximation in the semiclassical regime in order to find the wave function for various values of the inflaton field.
\item Using appropriate boundary conditions we constructed the quantum probability density distribution for this inflationary model.
\end{itemize}
