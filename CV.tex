                        \item The main purpose of this project was to see whether initial conditions favouring inflation are probable.
                        \item We approximated the Starobinsky potential as a step function and we used the WKB approximation in the semiclassical regime in order to find the wave function for various values of the inflaton field.
                        \item Using appropriate boundary conditions we constructed the quantum probability density distribution for this inflationary model.
